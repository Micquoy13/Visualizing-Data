# Visualizing Data
In [this chapter](https://neuraldatascience.io/4-viz/introduction.html), we will introduce core Python visualization packages, Matplotlib and Seaborn, as well as talking about topics such as accessibility and the choice of colour maps.
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- use Matplotlib to visualize data using a variety of types of plots

- understand the difference between state-based and object-oriented uses of Matplotlib

- use Seaborn to visualize data using a variety of types of plots

- understand use cases where Seaborn can be preferable to Matplotlib

- Recognize and appropriately use strategies for visualizing continuous and categorical data

- Visualize and reason about the distributions of data

- understand human factors considerations in visualization
